### Gulp Based Theme Development Workflow

Our gulp script in themes include the following tasks -

- Styles Task

- Images Task
- Translation Task
- Google Fonts Task
- Bundle Task
- Replace Task

Each of these tasks have their own sub-tasks which conclude the final behavior of this script that is building & releasing for development as well as production.
